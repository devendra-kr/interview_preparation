1. scala variance
===> Variance defines Inheritance relationships of Parameterized Types. Variance is all about Sub-Typing.
Scala Variance Type	---->	Syntax ----> Description
Covariant	----> [+T]	----> If S is subtype of T, then List[S] is also subtype of List[T]
Contravariant	---->	[-T] ----> If S is subtype of T, then List[T] is also subtype of List[S]
Invariant		----> [T]		----> If S is subtype of T, then List[S] and List[T] are unrelated.

2. Referential transparency
===> An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced by its resulting value without changing the behavior of the program.

3. Future and Promise
====> A Future is a placeholder object for a value that may not yet exist. (faster, asynchronous, non-blocking parallel)
====> While futures are defined as a type of read-only placeholder object created for a result which doesn’t yet exist, a promise can be thought
of as a writable, single-assignment container, which completes a future.

4. Exception handling into Future
===> recover and andthen

5. Future can deal with : for and yield, flatmap

6. Type Inference
===> determining the type of a variable or expression or object etc at compile-time by compiler is known as “Type Inference”

7. closure function
A closure is a function, whose return value depends on the value of one or more variables declared outside this function.
The benefits of closure function is out side of variable always evaluated whenever the function called.
